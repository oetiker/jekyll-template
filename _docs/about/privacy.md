# Privacy Policy

The OmniOS Community Edition Association cares about Data Protection.
The use of our website as well as of OmniOS is possible without any
registration; if you decide to become a patron or if you subscribe to a
support contract we will use your data only in connection with these
two services.

If you download the OmniOS installation media, hot-fixes or package updates
we will record your Internet Protocol address (_IP address_), information
derived from your IP address such as your geographic location, and metadata
relating to the system being updated. We do NOT correlate these data with
personal data.  They are retained for a period of three months and used for
the production of aggregate statistics regarding OmniOS usage.

If you become a Patron, we will not store any data about you directly. 
Your payment data is stored by our payment provider Stripe according to
their own GDPR compliant [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/ch/privacy)
which means your data will not be used for anything outside of processing
your payments to OmniOS.  For recurring payments we will always inform you
before the payment gets collected and offer you the option of cancelling
your subscription.

If you buy an OmniOSce support contract, we will store your contact data
to be able to communicate with you about your contract and matters related
to that.

It is our intention that our processing of personal data shall always be
in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
with the Swiss data protection regulations applicable to the OmniOS
Community Edition Association.

If you have any concern in regards to our handling of your data, please feel
free to [contact us](contact.html) at any time.
